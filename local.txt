To run the project on a local environment (such as Mac trough terminal), first do 

brew update & brew upgrade

to update HomeBrew and then

brew install redis

to install Redis locally.
After that, you should save the following as a textfile into the project directory named as '.env'

export PORT=4000 
export NODE_ENV=development 
export API_ROOT=https://api-local.quickframe.com:8080 
export API_VERSION=v1 
export MEDIA_URL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/quickframe-media-dev/ 
export STATIC_URL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/quickframe-static-dev/ 
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIILRAYHRCIOFIR4Q 
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=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 
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 
export BASENAME=/ 
export REDIS_HOST=localhost 
export FEATURE_CONTACT=1 
export FEATURE_EXPLORE=1 
export FEATURE_LOGIN=1 
export FEATURE_SIGNUP=1

This sets all the required variables for you.
You have to add a line to your /etc/hosts file, so

echo '127.0.0.1       lumiary-local.quickframe.com api-local.quickframe.com' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

which will ask for your password and then add a line to the hosts file. Now CD into the project directory, and then run

npm install

whicn install all the required files and then

npm run vendor

to compile all vendor-files into a single dll-package. To start the project run

source .env && npm run start

which runs the server on the local port 4000, so the URL will be:

https://lumiary-local.quickframe.com:4000
